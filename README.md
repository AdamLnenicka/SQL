TASK #2
Create and compile SQL statements to create the appropriate tables. Then import the data into these tables. The catch is, data is entered in different data formats. To import data into the database you will need to transform, correct and adjust the data.

TASK #3

Create SQL queries as required below:

1. List the most frequently used expression as a keyword for recorded books (not copies) published in the city "Hoboken, NJ". If there are multiple expressions with the same number of books, select the one that comes first alphabetically in the list.

2. List the most requested expression (used as a keyword). In other words, books are characterized by keywords. We are interested in which expression was borrowed most frequently. If there are multiple expressions with the same number of borrowings, select the one that comes last alphabetically in the list. 

3. List how many different expressions were used as keywords for recorded copies for which the responsible person with the login "dvorai0" is responsible. 

4. For how many recorded copies in the department "Development of logistic systems" is the expression used as a keyword, which is the most common expression among copies of this department? 

5. List the title of the book (even in multiple copies) that was most frequently borrowed from books by the publisher "McGraw-Hill". If there are multiple books with the same number of borrowings, select the one that comes first alphabetically in the list. 

6. What was the number of borrowings of books (copies) with the keyword "money" by the person who borrowed books with this expression most frequently?
7. 
8. Who most frequently borrowed books from other users, although they themselves own them. (This means the total number of borrowed copies of any book they own.) If there are users with the maximum number, sort them alphabetically by login and print the name and surname of the first person. Print the result in the format "NAME --- surname".

9. List how many books were borrowed more frequently than the average for borrowing one book (meaning a specific title, even in multiple copies). Consider only those books that were borrowed at least once. 

10. How many books have an edition listed?

11. What is the average year of publication of books (not copies)? Only count books where the publication year is listed. Round the result to three decimal places. 

12. Which publisher has the longest name? If there are multiple publishers with the same length name, select the first alphabetically (print their name). [5b]

13. What percentage of books have an edition listed? Round to three decimal places.

14. What percentage of people do not have an email address listed? Round to three decimal places.

15. List the ISBN of the book that was not part of an edition, has at least 182 pages, and the publisher's name contains the letter "z" (case insensitive). If there are multiple such books, select the one with the title alphabetically first. 

16. How many books have more pages than the average number of pages of books published in the same place of publication? 

17. How many copies were returned within two days of borrowing? 

18. Print the name and surname of the person whose borrowed copies were most frequently returned after the set deadline. If there are multiple people, select the one with the higher ID. Use the format for printing: "name SURNAME" (first name all lowercase, surname all uppercase). [5b]

19. What keyword is the most frequent for copies recorded at the "Telecommunication Institute"? If there are multiple expressions in the first place, select the first one alphabetically. [5b]
